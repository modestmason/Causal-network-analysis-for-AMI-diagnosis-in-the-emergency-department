This repository is build to support the causal network analysis for AMI diagnosis in the emergency department, as the Supplementary Materials of the submitted paper.
It contains four parts:
1. The processed structural data from real EMRs, and the established causal network based on the proposed method in the paper.
2. AMI diagnosis and model validation, as well as the comparative codes for data-driven methods.
3. EI calculation method to quantify the causal effects between variables and the onset of AMI.
4. Sensitivity analysis on unobserved confounding bias based on https://github.com/anishazaveri/austen_plots.
